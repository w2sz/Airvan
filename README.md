# Airvan

Airvan is an inexpensive and mass reproducible open source, open hardware general aeronautical platform easily accessible and usable by the average person. With modular payloads, this platform may be used for different purposes, such as:

- Radio communication relay
- Aerial photography
- Surveying
- Cargo delivery
- etc.

For instance, AirRepeater - an application that loads Airvan with radio repeater system - can be used to establish long range radio communications in events of environmental and human caused disaster.
