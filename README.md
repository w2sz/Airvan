Airvan is an inexpensive and mass reproducible open source, open hardware general autonomous aeronautical platform easily accessible and usable by the average person.

With modular payloads, this platform may be used for different purposes, such as:

- Radio communication relay
- Aerial photography
- Surveying
- Cargo delivery
- etc.

Example use case:

1. AirRepeater (Airvan + Radio Repeater) can be used to establish long range radio communications in the aftermath of environmental and human caused disaster.
2. AirLens (Airvan + Camera + Computer Vision) can perform search and rescue with computer vision technology to spot creatures/objects in motion at a distance.
3. AirSurveyor (Airvan + Camera + Photogrammetry) scan the landscape and generate orthomosaic maps or 3D textured mesh for civil engineering use.

## Specification

The project is in the active early design stage now. Specifications are subject to change.

### General Airvan

- Maximum flight time: 120 minutes
- Maximum payload weight: 2.5 kg (5-1/2 lbs)
- Maximum dimension when folded: 1.3 m (4-1/4 ft)

### AirRepeater

- Repeater coverage: 80 km (50 mi) in radius, open space
- Transmitting power: 5 watts

## Technical Approach

- Foam boards for main body with carbon fiber for structural strength.
